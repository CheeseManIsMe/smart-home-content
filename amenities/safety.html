            <p>To keep your home as safe as possible from the 
                threat of fire, it is equipped with highly advanced fire suppression systems!</p>

            <h2>Fire Safety Systems:</h2>

            <h3>Fire Alarm</h3>
            <p>This highly advanced fire alarm is incredibly sensitive to even the slightest amount of smoke!
                This gives you an earlier warning to leave the home and call emergency resopnders.
            </p>

            <h3>Water Sprinklers</h3>
            <p>These water sprinklers will begin spraying water in any room that a fire alarm has gone off in.
                This can help slow the spread of fires or completely extinguish smaller fires!
            </p>

            <h3>Water Mice</h3>
            <p>These modified Sweeper Mice have had their dust collection unit replaced with a small water tank.
                This allows them to essentially be the very first responders in the case of a small fire in your home!
            </p>

            <h3>Fire Snakes</h3>
            <p>These mechanized hoses are your home's last line of defense against an out of control fire. They spray a green
                 foam to hopefully extinguish the fire, or to at least give firefighters more time to respond!
            </p>
