    <h1>Safety Technology</h1>    

        <p>To keep your home as safe as possible from the 
            threat of fire, it is equipped with highly advanced fire suppression systems!</p>

        <h2>Fire Safety Systems:</h2>

        <h3>Fire Alarm</h3>
        <p>These incredibly advanced fire alarms can detect even the slightest amount of 
            smoke! This gives you an incredibly early warning to a possible home fire.
        </p>

        <h3>Water Sprinklers</h3>
        <p>These water sprinklers begin spraying after a fire alarm has gone off. This can 
            help slow, or even stop, the spread of a fire!
        </p>

        <h3>Water Mice</h3>
        <p>These slightly modified sweeper mice have a small built in water tank that can be
            used to spray smaller house fires.
        </p>

        <h3>Foam Snakes</h3>
        <p>These mechanical hoses drop down from the attic in when a fire reaches an immense size. They use a green foam to slow down the spread of 
            the fire to give fire fighters more time to respond.
