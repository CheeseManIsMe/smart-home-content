            <p>This home comes fully equipped with a built in squadron of cleaning robots that will keep your home <em>sparkling</em> clean!</p>

            <h2>Meet The Cleaning Team:</h2>

            <p>First up, we have the tiny Sweeper Mouse! They come out at predetermined times to sweep your floors of all dust and/or mud! They then deposit this into docking ports within the walls of your home to be disposed of at a later date.  </p>

            <p>Next up is the Scrap Rat! This larger cousin of the Sweeper Mouse specializes in gathering larger pieces of trash and disposing of them in the home's incinerator. They utilize their powerful grabbing claw to be able to clean at a rate of approximately 4lbs of mass per minute!</p>

            <p>Last, but certainly not least, we have our Automatic Dish Cleaner! This is a robotic sink that uses small grasping claws to grab and scrub your dishes while powerful water streams blast away any remaining grime or filth!</p>
